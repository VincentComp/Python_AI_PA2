# Overview
Comp2211 Exploring Artificial Intelligence <br>
In this Project, we perform Retinal Vessel Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), which includes
* 1 Image preprocessing with Contrast Stretching, Re-scaling
* 2 Build the Convolutional Neural Networks
* 3 Evaluating the model with the dice coefficent
